#Retail Sales Forecasting

This project aims to predict weekly retail sales using machine learning techniques such as Random Forest and XGBoost. The dataset contains historical sales data, and the goal is to forecast future sales based on several features, including store details, temperature, fuel price, markdowns, and holidays.

##Files

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files (e.g., sales data).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.

##Installation

1. Clone the repository:

## Model Performance

- Random Forest Regressor was used as the baseline model.
- The final model achieved a high RÂ² score and low Mean Squared Error.
